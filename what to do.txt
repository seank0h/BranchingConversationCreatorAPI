Documentation:
Purpose of my Site: My site's purpose is for a visual flowchart maker where one can create text boxes that are draggable and constrained in
a box to visually represent flow of text and branching narratives
What My Site Does: My site lets one createa flowchart, add text boxes that are draggable and stil inputable and then save it to the server
A user can retrieve flowcharts that are created and it loads the textboxes but not the textboxes
API Handle: My API handles getting the flowcharts, and sending the flowcharts. The server was used to send the flowchart obect 
What Went Right: The creation of text boxes and data posting of the flowchart was done pretty easily. 
What Went Wrong: Getting specific instances of data and making the textboxes both draggable and inputable
Things to Improve:
The most glaring one would be to actually be able to load the textboxes, I can see a fix being parsing the data more in the server side and send the data back to the client
Being able to edit the text of other textboxes and not the one just created. I can forsee creating a button that will be added to each div that a user can click to edit
The content box visually could be moved more to the center
How I went Above and Beyond:
Learned jquery
